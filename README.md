# Driving & RTO Web Application - Server Side

Welcome to the server-side repository of our Driving & RTO Web Application project. This repository contains the backend logic and server setup for the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** Our backend is built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js:** We utilize Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js, to handle routing and middleware.
- **MongoDB:** The database used for storing user information, application data, and other relevant details.
- **Mongoose:** Mongoose is an ODM (Object-Document Mapper) for MongoDB and is used for data modeling and interaction.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured layout to maintain organization and modularity. Here's a brief overview:

- **`/src`:** Contains the source code for the server.
  - **`/controllers`:** Handles business logic and interacts with the database.
  - **`/models`:** Defines Mongoose models for data structures.
  - **`/routes`:** Manages route definitions and middleware.
  - **`/config`:** Configuration files, such as database connections.
  - **`/middleware`:** Custom middleware functions.
- **`index.js`:** The main entry point for the server.
